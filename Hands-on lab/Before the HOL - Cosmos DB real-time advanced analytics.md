# Cosmos DB real-time advanced analytics before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription (non-Microsoft subscription, must be a pay-as-you subscription).
2. **IMPORTANT**: To complete the OAuth 2.0 access components of this hands-on lab you must have permissions within your Azure subscription to create an App Registration and service principal within Azure Active Directory.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 60 minutes

In the Before the hands-on lab exercise, you will set up your environment for use in the rest of the hands-on lab. You should follow all the steps provided in the Before the hands-on lab section to prepare your environment **before attending** the hands-on lab. Failure to do so will significantly impact your ability to complete the lab within the time allowed.

> **Important**: Most Azure resources require unique names. Throughout this lab you will see the word “SUFFIX” as part of resource names. You should replace this with your Microsoft alias, initials, or another value to ensure the resource is uniquely named.

### Task 1: Set up a development environment

If you do not have a machine with Visual Studio Community 2017 (or greater) and the Azure development workload, complete this task.

1. Create a virtual machine (VM) in Azure using the **Visual Studio Community 2017 (latest release) on Windows Server 2016 (x64)** image. A Windows 10 image will work as well.

   ![In Azure Portal, in the search field, Visual Studio Community 2017 on Windows Server 2016 (x64) is typed. Under Results, Visual Studio Community 2017 on Windows Server 2016 (x64) is selected.](media/create-resource-visual-studio.png 'Azure Portal')

   a. In the Azure portal, select **+ Create a resource** from the left-hand menu.

   b. Type **Visual Studio**.

   c. Select the **Visual Studio Community 2017 (latest release) on Windows Server 2016 (x64)**.

   d. Click **Create**.

   e. Select your subscription and recently created resource group.

   f. For the name, type **MainVM**, or some other globally unique name (as indicated by the checkmark).

   g. Leave the availability option as **No infrastructure redundancy required**.

   h. Ensure the image is **Visual Studio Community 2017 (latest release) on Windows Server 2016 (x64)**.

   i. Select your VM size.

   > **Note**: It is highly recommended to use a DS2 or D2 instance size for this VM.

   j. For username, type **demouser**.

   k. For password, type **Password.1!!**

   l. Click **Next : Disks**.

   m. Click **Next : Networking**.

   n. Click **Allow selected ports**.

   o. For the inbound ports, select **RDP (3389)**.

   p. Click **Review + create**.

   q. Click **Create**.

### Task 2: Disable IE Enhanced Security

> **Note**: Sometimes this image has IE ESC disabled. Sometimes it does not.

1. Login to the newly created VM using RDP and the username and password you supplied earlier.

2. After the VM loads, the Server Manager should open.

3. Select **Local Server**.

   ![Local Server is selected from the Server Manager menu.](media/local-server.png 'Server Manager menu')

4. On the side of the pane, for **IE Enhanced Security Configuration**, if it displays **On** select it.

   ![Screenshot of IE Enhanced Security Configuration, which is set to On.](media/ie-enhanced-security.png 'IE Enhanced Security Configuration')

   - Change to **Off** for Administrators and select **OK**.

   ![In the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration dialog box, under Administrators, the Off button is selected.](media/ie-enhanced-security-configuration.png 'Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration dialog box')

### Task 3: Install Google Chrome

> **Note**: Some aspects of this lab require the use of Google Chrome. You may find yourself blocked if using Internet Explorer later in the lab.

1. Launch Internet Explorer and download [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

2. Follow the setup instructions and make sure you can run Chrome to navigate to any webpage.

> **Note**: Chrome is needed for one of the labs as Internet Explorer is not supported for some specific activities.

### Task 4: Validate connectivity to Azure

1. From within the virtual machine, launch Visual Studio and validate that you can log in with your Microsoft Account when prompted.

2. To validate connectivity to your Azure subscription, open **Server Explorer** from the **View** menu, and ensure that you can connect to your Azure subscription.

   ![In Server Explorer, Azure is selected, and its right-click menu displays with options to Refresh, Connect to Microsoft Azure Subscription, Manage and Filter Subscriptions, or Open the Getting Started Page.](media/vs-server-explorer.png 'Server Explorer')

### Task 5: Download the starter files

Download a starter project that includes a payment data generator that sends real-time payment data for processing by your lab solution, as well as data files used in the lab.

1. From your LabVM, download the starter files by downloading a .zip copy of the Cosmos DB real-time advanced analytics GitHub repo.

2. In a web browser, navigate to the [Cosmos DB real-time advanced analytics MCW repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/MCW-Cosmos-DB-Real-Time-Advanced-Analytics).

3. On the repo page, select **Clone or download**, then select **Download ZIP**.

   ![Download .zip containing the repository](media/git-hub-download-repo.png 'Download ZIP')

4. Unzip the contents to the folder `C:\CosmosMCW\`.

### Task 6: Download and install Power BI Desktop

Power BI desktop is required to make a connection to your Azure Databricks environment when creating the Power BI dashboard.

1. From your LabVM, download and install [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).

### Task 7: Provision a resource group

In this task, you will create an Azure resource group for the resources used throughout this lab.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the left-hand navigation menu, select **+Add**, and then enter the following in the Create a resource group blade:

   - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.

   - **Resource group name**: Enter hands-on-lab-SUFFIX.

   - **Region**: Select the region you would like to use for resources in this hands-on lab. Remember this location so you can use it for the other resources you'll provision throughout this lab.

     ![Add Resource group Resource groups is highlighted in the navigation pane of the Azure portal, +Add is highlighted in the Resource groups blade, and "hands-on-labs" is entered into the Resource group name box on the Create an empty resource group blade.](./media/create-resource-group.png 'Create resource group')

2. Select **Review + create**.

3. On the Summary blade, select **Create** to provision your resource group.

### Task 8: Deploy Environment
