# Cosmos DB real-time advanced analytics hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

Woodgrove Bank, who provides payment processing services for commerce, is looking to design and implement a PoC of an innovative fraud detection solution. They want to provide new services to their merchant customers, helping them save costs by applying machine learning and advanced analytics to detect fraudulent transactions. Their customers are around the world, and the right solutions for them would minimize any latencies experienced using their service by distributing as much of the solution as possible, as closely as possible, to the regions in which their customers use the service.

In this hands-on lab session, you will implement a PoC of the data pipeline that could support the needs of Woodgrove Bank.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to implement solutions that leverage the strengths of Cosmos DB in support of advanced analytics solutions that require high throughput ingest, low latency serving and global scale in combination with scalable machine learning, big data and real-time processing capabilities.

## Overview

Woodgrove Bank, who provides payment processing services for commerce, is looking to design and implement a proof-of-concept (PoC) of an innovative fraud detection solution. They want to provide new services to their merchant customers, helping them save costs by applying machine learning and advanced analytics to detect fraudulent transactions. Their customers are around the world, and the right solutions for them would minimize any latencies experienced using their service by distributing as much of the solution as possible, as closely as possible, to the regions in which their customers use the service.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![The Solution diagram is described in the text following this diagram.](../Media/outline-architecture.png 'Solution diagram')

The solution begins with the payment transaction systems writing transactions to Azure Cosmos DB. Using the built-in change feed feature in Cosmos DB, the transactions can be read as a stream of incoming data within an Azure Databricks notebook, using the `azure-cosmosdb-spark` connector, and stored long-term within an Azure Databricks Delta table backed by Azure Data Lake Storage. The Delta tables efficiently manage inserts and updates (e.g., upserts) to the transaction data. Tables created in Databricks over this data can be accessed by business analysts using dashboards and reports in Power BI, by using Power BI's Spark connector. Alternately, semantic models can be stored in Azure Analysis Service to serve data to Power BI, eliminating the need to keep a dedicated Databricks cluster running for reporting.
Data scientists and engineers can create their own reports against Databricks tables, using Azure Databricks notebooks.

Azure Databricks also supports training and validating the machine learning model, using historical data stored in Azure Data Lake Storage. The model can be periodically re-trained using the data stored in Delta tables or other historical tables. The Azure Machine Learning service is used to deploy the trained model as a real-time scoring web service running on a highly available Azure Kubernetes Service cluster (AKS cluster). The trained model is also used in scheduled offline scoring through Databricks jobs, and the "suspicious activity" output is stored in Azure Cosmos DB so it is globally available in regions closest to Woodgrove Bank's customers through their web applications.

Finally, Azure Key Vault is used to securely store secrets, such as account keys and connection strings, and serves as a backing for Azure Databricks secret scopes.

> **Note**: The preferred solution is only one of many possible, viable approaches.

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription (non-Microsoft subscription, must be a pay-as-you subscription).
2. An Azure Databricks cluster running Databricks Runtime 5.1 or above. Azure Databricks integration with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 is **fully supported in Databricks Runtime 5.1**.
   - **IMPORTANT**: To complete the OAuth 2.0 access components of this hands-on lab you must:
     - Have a cluster running Databricks Runtime 5.1 and above.
     - Have permissions within your Azure subscription to create an App Registration and service principal within Azure Active Directory.

## Exercise 1: Collecting streaming transaction data

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will configure a payment transaction generator to write real-time streaming online payments to both Event Hubs and Azure Cosmos DB. By the end, you will have selected the best ingest option before continuing to the following exercise where you will process the generated data.

### Task 1: Configuring Event Hubs and the transaction generator

In this task, you will configure the payment transaction data generator project by completing TODO items in the source code and adding connection information for your Event Hub.

1. Open File Explorer on your machine or VM and navigate to the location you extracted the MCW repo .zip file to (C:\\CosmosMCW\\).

2. Open **TransactionGenerator.sln** in the `Hands-on lab\lab-files\TransactionGenerator` directory. This will open the solution in Visual Studio.

   ![Screenshot of the solution folder with the TransactionGenerator.sln file selected.](media/solution-folder.png 'File Explorer')

3. Double-click `appsettings.json` in the Solution Explorer to open it. This file contains the settings used by the console app to connect to your Azure services and to configure application behavior settings. The console app is programmed to either use values stored in this file, or within the machine's environment variables. This makes you capable of distributing the executable or containerizing it and passing in environment variables via the command line.

   ![appsettings.json is highlighted in the Visual Studio Solution Explorer.](media/solution-explorer.png 'Solution Explorer')

   The `appsettings.json` file contains the following:

   ```javascript
   {
       "EVENT_HUB_1_CONNECTION_STRING": "",
       "EVENT_HUB_2_CONNECTION_STRING": "",
       "EVENT_HUB_3_CONNECTION_STRING": "",

       "COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT": "",
       "COSMOS_DB_AUTH_KEY": "",

       "SECONDS_TO_LEAD": "0",
       "SECONDS_TO_RUN": "600",
       "ONLY_WRITE_TO_COSMOS_DB": "false"
   }
   ```

   `SECONDS_TO_LEAD` is the amount of time to wait before sending payment transaction data. Default value is `0`.

   `SECONDS_TO_RUN` is the maximum amount of time to allow the generator to run before stopping transmission of data. The default value is `600`. Data will also stop transmitting after the included `Untagged_Transactions.csv` file's data has been sent.

   If the `ONLY_WRITE_TO_COSMOS_DB` property is set to `true`, no records will be sent to the Event Hubs instances. Default value is `false`.

4. Copy your Event Hub connection string value you copied from the `Sender` policy and saved during the steps you completed in the before the hands-on lab setup guide. Paste this value into the double-quotes located next to `EVENT_HUB_1_CONNECTION_STRING`.

   ![The Event Hub connection string is pasted in appsettings.json.](media/event-hub-connection-string.png 'appsettings.json')

5. Save the file.

6. Open `Program.cs` in the Visual Studio Solution Explorer.

7. In Visual Studio, select **View**, then **Task List** from the dropdown menu.

   ![In Visual Studio, select View then Task List.](media/select-task-list.png 'Select task list')

   This will display the TODO items within the code comments as a list of tasks you can double-click to jump to its location.

   ![Screenshot of the task list.](media/task-list.png 'Visual Studio Task List')

8. Go to **TODO 1** located in `Program.cs` by double-clicking the item in the Task List. Paste the following code under TODO 1, which uses the Event Hub client to send the event data, setting the partition key to `IpCountryCode`:

   ```csharp
   await eventHubClient.SendAsync(eventData: eventData,
       partitionKey: transaction.IpCountryCode).ConfigureAwait(false);
   ```

   Your completed code should look like the following:

   ![Screenshot of completed TODO 1 code.](media/completed-todo-1-code.png 'Completed code')

9. Paste the code below under **TODO 2** to increment the count of the number of Event Hub requests that succeeded:

   ```csharp
   _eventHubRequestsSucceededInBatch++;
   ```

10. Paste the code below under **TODO 3** to instantiate a new Event Hub client and add it to the `eventHubClients` collection:

    ```csharp
    EventHubClient.CreateFromConnectionString(
        arguments.EventHubConnectionString
    ),
    ```

11. Save your changes.

### Task 2: Ingesting streaming data into Cosmos DB

In this task, you will configure Cosmos DB's time-to-live (TTL) settings to On with no default. This will allow the data generator to expire, or delete, the ingested messages after any desired period of time by setting the TTL value (object property of `ttl`) on individual messages as they are sent.

Next you will pass in the Azure Cosmos DB URI and Key values to the data generator so it can connect to and send events to your collection.

1. Navigate to your Azure Cosmos DB account in the Azure portal, then select **Data Explorer** on the left-hand menu.

   ![Data Explorer is selected within the left-hand menu](media/cosmos-db-data-explorer-link.png 'Select Data Explorer')

2. Expand your **Woodgrove** database and your **transactions** collection, then select **Scale & Settings**.

3. Under Settings within the Scale & Settings blade, select the **On (no default)** option for Time to Live. This setting is required to allow documents added to the collection to be configured with their own TTL values.

   ![The Scale & Settings blade is shown with the On (no default) Time to Live option selected.](media/cosmos-db-ttl-settings.png 'Scale & Settings blade')

4. Select **Save** to apply your settings.

5. Open Visual Studio to go back to the TransactionGenerator project.

6. Open the `appsettings.json` file once more. Paste your Cosmos DB endpoint value next to `COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT`, and the Cosmos DB authorization key next to `COSMOS_DB_AUTH_KEY`. You recorded these values during the Cosmos DB provisioning steps in the before the hands-on lab setup guide. For example:

   ![The Cosmos DB values have been added to appsettings.json](media/cosmos-db-values.png 'appsettings.json')

7. Open `Program.cs` and paste the code below under **TODO 4** to send the generated transaction data to Cosmos DB and store the returned `ResourceResponse` object into a new variable for statistics about RU/s used:

   ```csharp
   var response = await _cosmosDbClient.CreateDocumentAsync(collectionUri, transaction)
       .ConfigureAwait(false);
   ```

8. Paste the code below under **TODO 5** to append the number of RU/s consumed to the `_cosmosRUsPerBatch` variable:

   ```csharp
   _cosmosRUsPerBatch += response.RequestCharge;
   ```

9. Paste the code below under **TODO 6** to set the Cosmos DB connection policy:

   ```csharp
   var connectionPolicy = new ConnectionPolicy
   {
       ConnectionMode = ConnectionMode.Direct,
       ConnectionProtocol = Protocol.Tcp
   };
   ```

10. Save your changes.

11. Run the console app by clicking **Debug**, then **Start Debugging** in the top menu in Visual Studio, or press _F-5_ on your keyboard.

    ![Screenshot showing the Debug menu expanded in Visual Studio with the Start Debugging menu option highlighted.](media/debug-in-vs.png 'Debug')

12. The PaymentGenerator console window will open, and you should see it start to send data after a few seconds. You may close the window or press `Ctrl+C` or `Ctrl+Break` at any time to stop sending data to Event Hubs and Cosmos DB.

    ![Screenshot of the PaymentGenerator console window running.](media/payment-generator-console.png 'Payment Generator console window')

    The top of the output displays information about the Cosmos DB collection you created (transactions), the requested RU/s as well as estimated hourly and monthly cost. After every 1,000 records are requested to be sent, you will see output statistics so you can compare Event Hubs to Cosmos DB. Be on the lookout for the following:

    - Compare Event Hub to Cosmos DB statistics. They should have similar processing times and successful calls.
    - Inserted line shows successful inserts in this batch and throughput for writes/second with RU/s usage and estimated monthly ingestion rate added to Cosmos DB statistics.
    - Processing time: Shows whether the processing time for the past 1,000 requested inserts is faster or slower than the other service.
    - Total elapsed time: Running total of time taken to process all documents.
    - If this value continues to grow higher for Cosmos DB vs. Event Hubs, that is a good indicator that the Cosmos DB requests are being throttled. Consider increasing the RU/s for the container.
    - Succeeded shows number of accumulative successful inserts to the service.
    - Pending are items in the bulkhead queue. This amount will continue to grow if the service is unable to keep up with demand.
    - Accumulative failed requests that encountered an exception.
    
    > The obvious and recommended method for sending a lot of data is to do so in batches. This method can multiply the amount of data sent with each request by hundreds or thousands. However, the point of our exercise is not to maximize throughput and send as much data as possible, but to compare the relative performance between Event Hubs and Cosmos DB.

13. As an experiment, scale the number of requested RU/s for your Cosmos DB collection down to 700. After doing so, you should see increasingly slower transfer rates to Cosmos DB due to throttling. You will also see the pending queue growing at a higher rate. The reason for this is because when the number of writes (remember, writes _typically_ use 5 RU/s vs. just 1 RU/s for reads on 1 KB-sized documents) exceeds the allotted amount of RU/s, Cosmos DB sends a 429 response with a _retry_after_ header value to tell the consumer that it is resource-constrained. The SDK automatically handles this by waiting for the specified amount of time, then retrying. After you are done experimenting, set the RU/s back to 15,000.

### Task 3: Choosing between Cosmos DB and Event Hubs for ingestion

Woodgrove Bank has a number of requirements around ingesting payment data, including data retention of the hot data and geographic locations to which the data is replicated for high availability and global distribution of the data for processing. There are many similarities between Event Hubs and Cosmos DB that allow both to work well for data ingestion. However, these services have some significant differences in their overall feature set that you need to evaluate to choose the best option for this customer situation.

In this exercise, you will use the data generator to send data to both Event Hubs and Cosmos DB and compare the performance of the two. You will also configure the generator and the services to set message retention and to send data to various global regions.

1. Open Visual Studio and paste the code below under **TODO 7** (located within `Transaction.cs`) to set the time to live (TTL) value to 60 days (in seconds):

   ```csharp
   tx.TimeToLive = 60 * 60 * 24 * 60;
   ```

   This configures Cosmos DB to automatically delete the ingested messages after 60 days by setting the TTL value (`ttl` property) on individual messages as they are sent. This optimization helps save in storage costs while meeting Woodgrove Bank's requirement to keep the streaming data available for that amount of time so they can reprocess in Azure Databricks, or query the raw data within the collection as needed.

   > Setting the TTL for documents saved to Cosmos DB individually for any length of time desired (even beyond 7 days) is an advantage Cosmos DB has over Event Hubs when used for ingesting streaming data.

2. Save your changes.

3. Navigate to your Event Hubs namespace for this lab in the Azure portal. Select **Event Hubs** from the left-hand menu.

   ![Event Hubs is selected within the left-hand menu](media/select-event-hubs.png 'Select Event Hubs')

4. Select your **transactions** event hub.

5. Select **Properties** on the left-hand menu.

6. Drag the **Message Retention** slider all the way to the right to set the value to 7. This is as long as you can set message retention for Event Hubs messages using the portal UI. It is possible to contact Microsoft to set the value to as many as 4 weeks. Unfortunately, this does not meet Woodgrove Bank's requirements for retaining this hot data for 60 days.

   ![Screenshot displaying the event hub properties and the Message Retention value being set to 7.](media/event-hub-message-retention.png 'Properties')

7. Select **Save Changes**.

   > Woodgrove Bank wants to write all transaction data simultaneously to three different geographic locations: United States, Great Britain, and East Asia. All data should be able to be read from these locations with as little latency as possible. They require this for redundancy purposes as well as being able to better process the data in those regions.

8. Create two more Event Hubs namespaces and event hubs within to ingest transaction data. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **+ Create a resource**, enter "event hubs" into the Search the Marketplace box, select **Event Hubs** from the results, and then select **Create**.

   ![Create a resource is highlighted in the left-hand navigation menu of the Azure portal, event hubs is entered into the Search the Marketplace box, and Event Hubs is highlighted in the results.](media/create-resource-event-hubs.png 'Create an Event Hubs namespace')

9. On the Create Namespace blade, enter the following:

   - **Name**: Enter a globally unique name (indicated by a green check mark).

   - **Throughput Units**: Set the slider all the way to the left, setting the value to 1.
   - **Enable Auto-Inflate**: Unchecked

   ![The Create Namespace blade is displayed, with the previously mentioned settings entered into the appropriate fields.](media/create-event-hubs-blade-uk.png 'Create Namespace')

10. Select **Create**.

11. Navigate to the newly provisioned Event Hubs namespace in the Azure portal, then select **Event Hubs** under Entities on the left-hand menu.

    ![Event Hubs is selected within the left-hand menu](media/select-event-hubs.png 'Select Event Hubs')

12. Select **+ Event Hub** in the top toolbar.

    ![Select the + Event Hub button in the top toolbar](media/add-event-hub-button.png 'Add Event Hub')

13. In the **Create Event Hub** blade, configure the following:

    - **Name**: Enter "transactions".
    - **Partition Count**: Move the slider to set the value to 10.
    - **Message Retention**: Set to 7.
    - **Capture**: Off

    ![The Create Event Hub blade is displayed, with the previously mentioned settings entered into the appropriate fields](media/create-event-hub-blade-7-day-retention.png 'Create Event Hub')

14. Select **Create**.

15. After the new Event Hub is created, select it then select **Shared access policies** under Settings in the left-hand menu.

    ![Shared access policies is selected within the left-hand menu](media/select-shared-access-policies.png 'Select Shared access policies')

16. Select **+ Add** in the top toolbar.

    ![Select the + Add button in the top toolbar](media/add-shared-access-policy.png 'Add Shared Access Policy')

17. In the **Add SAS Policy** blade, configure the following:

    - **Policy name**: Enter "Sender".
    - **Manage**: Unchecked
    - **Send**: Checked
    - **Listen**: Unchecked

    ![The Add SAS Plicy is displayed, with the previously mentioned settings entered into the appropriate fields](media/add-sas-policy-sender.png 'Add SAS Policy')

18. Select **Create**.

19. Select **+ Add** in the top toolbar to add another policy.

    ![Select the + Add button in the top toolbar](media/add-shared-access-policy.png 'Add Shared Access Policy')

20. In the **Add SAS Policy** blade, configure the following:

    - **Policy name**: Enter "Listener".
    - **Manage**: Unchecked
    - **Send**: Unchecked
    - **Listen**: Checked

    ![The Add SAS Plicy is displayed, with the previously mentioned settings entered into the appropriate fields](media/add-sas-policy-listener.png 'Add SAS Policy')

21. Select **Create**.

22. Select the **Sender** access policy.

23. Copy the **Connection string-primary key** value. Save this value for the Sender policy in Notepad or similar for later.

24. **Repeat steps 8 through 23 above** to create a new Event Hub namespace in the **East Asia** region.

    ![Create Event Hubs Namespace blade with the East Asia Location selection highlighted.](media/create-event-hubs-blade-asia.png 'Create Namespace')

25. Open Visual Studio to go back to the TransactionGenerator project.

26. Open the `appsettings.json` file once more. Paste your two new Event Hub connection strings into the values for `EVENT_HUB_2_CONNECTION_STRING` and `EVENT_HUB_3_CONNECTION_STRING`, respectively.

    ![The two new Event Hub connection strings are pasted into the appsettings.json file.](media/event-hub-connection-strings.png 'appsettings.json')

27. Save your changes.

28. Open `Program.cs` and paste the below code underneath **TODO 8** to add two new Event Hub clients to the `eventHubClients` collection, using the two new connection string values:

    ```csharp
    EventHubClient.CreateFromConnectionString(
        arguments.EventHub2ConnectionString
    ),
    EventHubClient.CreateFromConnectionString(
        arguments.EventHub3ConnectionString
    )
    ```

    ![Screenshot displaying completed code.](media/event-hub-clients-added.png 'Program.cs')

29. Now, we will add the two additional regions to Cosmos DB. Navigate to the Azure portal and select your Cosmos DB account you created for this lab.

30. Select **Replicate data globally** underneath Settings in the left-hand menu.

    ![Left-hand menu with the Replicate data globally link highlighted.](media/replicate-data-globally-link.png 'Replicate data globally link')

31. Within the Replicate data globally blade, select **+ Add region** above the listed regions in the Configure regions section.

    ![Screenshot with the Add region link highlighted.](media/add-region-link.png 'Add region link')

    > Notice that there are already two regions and they each have both reads and writes enabled. This is because you enabled the geo-redundancy and multi-region writes options when you provisioned Cosmos DB.

32. Select **East Asia** in the dropdown list, then select **OK** to add the region.

    ![East Asia is selected and highlighted in the location dropdown list.](media/add-region-east-asia.png 'East Asia')

33. Select **+ Add region** again, this time selecting **UK South** in the dropdown list. Select **OK** to add the new region.

    ![UK South is selected and highlighted in the location dropdown list.](media/add-region-uk-south.png 'UK South')

34. Notice that the two new regions are highlighted on the world map, and each have both reads and writes enabled. Congratulations! You completed all the steps to write to and read from multiple regions around the world with Cosmos DB! Finally, select **Save** to save your changes.

    ![Map showing newly added regions for Cosmos DB.](media/replicate-data-globally-map.png 'Cosmos DB region map')

    > **Note**: You may have to wait several minutes for the change to take effect. In the meantime, you can feel free to continue and run the transaction generator. Cosmos DB can still ingest data as regions are being added. There should be no performance impact during this time or after the provisioning is complete.

35. Open Visual Studio and debug the TransactionGenerator project. Let it run for at least 2 minutes, or long enough to send 10,000 messages.

    ![The TransactionGenerator console shows event hubs overall running slower than Cosmos DB.](media/console-output-event-hubs-slower.png 'Console output')

    Results will vary depending on machine specifications and network speeds, but overall, it will likely take longer to send the data to the three Event Hub instances than to Cosmos DB. You may also notice the Event Hubs pending queue filling up quite a bit more. Also notice that you did not have to make any code changes to write to the additional Cosmos DB regions.

36. Open each of the three Event Hubs namespaces you have created for this lab. You should see an equal number of messages that were sent to each. The graph is shown on the bottom of the Overview blade. Select the **Messages** metric above the graph to view the number of messages received. The screenshot below is of the UK South Event Hub:

    ![The Messages metric is selected for the UK South Event Hubs namespace.](media/uk-south-metrics.png 'Event Hubs Overview blade')

37. View the data that was saved to Cosmos DB. Navigate to the Cosmos DB account for this lab in the Azure portal. Select **Data Explorer** on the left-hand menu. Expand the **Woodgrove** database and **transactions** collection, then select **Documents**. Select one of the documents from the list to view it. If you selected a more recently added document, notice that it contains a `ttl` value of 5,184,000 seconds, or 60 days. Also, there is a `collectionType` value of "Transaction". This allows consumers to query documents stored within the collection by the type. This is needed because a collection can contain any number of document types within, since it does not enforce any type of schema.

    ![Screenshot shows a document displayed within the Cosmos DB Data Explorer.](media/cosmos-db-document.png 'Cosmos DB Data Exporer')

Given the requirements provided by the customer, Cosmos DB is the best choice for ingesting data for this PoC. Cosmos DB allows for more flexible, and longer, TTL (message retention) than Event Hubs, which is capped at 7 days, or 4 weeks when you contact Microsoft to request the extra capacity. Another option for Event Hubs is to use Event Hubs Capture to simultaneously save ingested data to Blob Storage or Azure Data Lake Store for longer retention and cold storage. However, this will require additional development, including automatic clearing of the data after a period of time. In addition, Woodgrove Bank wanted to be able to easily query this data during the 60-day message retention period, from a database. This could also be accomplished through Azure Data Warehouse using Polybase to query the files, but that requires yet another service they may otherwise not need, as well as additional development, administration, and cost.

Finally, the requirement to synchronize/write the ingested data to multiple regions, which could grow at any time, makes Cosmos DB a more favorable choice. As you can see, there are more steps required to send data to additional regions using Event Hubs, since you have to provision new namespaces and Event Hub instances in each region. You would also have to account for all those instances on the consuming side, which we will not cover in this lab for sake of time. The ability to read/write to multiple regions by adding and removing them at will with no code or changes required is a great value that Cosmos DB adds. Plus, the fact that Cosmos DB will be used in this solution for serving batch-processed fraudulent data on a global scale means that Cosmos DB can be used to meet both the data ingest and delivery needs with no additional services, like Event Hubs, required.

We will continue the lab using Cosmos DB for data ingestion.

## Exercise 2: Understanding and preparing the transaction data at scale

Duration: 45 minutes

In this exercise, you will create connections from your Databricks workspace to ADLS Gen2 and Cosmos DB. Then, using Azure Databricks you will import and explore some of the historical raw transaction data provided by Woodgrove to gain a better understanding of the preparation that needs to be done prior to using the data for building and training a machine learning model. You will then use the connection to Cosmos DB from Databricks to read streaming transactions directly from the Cosmos DB Change Feed. Finally, you will write the incoming streaming transaction data into an Azure Databricks Delta table stored in your data lake.

### Task 1: Create a service principal for OAuth access to the ADLS Gen2 filesystem

As an added layer of security when accessing an ADLS Gen2 filesystem using Databricks you can use OAuth 2.0 for authentication. In this task, you will create an identity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) known as a service principal to facilitate the use of OAuth authentication.

    ![The cluster is displayed with the JDBC/ODBC tab selected, and the first JDBC URL value is highlighted.](media/databricks-jdbc.png 'JDBC/ODBC')

4.  Now, you need to modify the JDBC URL to construct the JDBC server address that you will use to set up your Spark cluster connection in Power BI Desktop.

    - In the JDBC URL:
      - Replace `jdbc:spark` with `https`.
      - Remove everything in the path between the port number and `/sql`.
      - Remove the following string from the end of the URL: `;AuthMech=3;UID=token;PWD=<personal-access-token>`, retaining the components indicated by the highlights in the image below.

    ![Parsed Cluster JDBC URL](media/databricks-cluster-jdbc-url-parsed.png 'Parsed JDBC URL')

    - In our example, the server address would be: `https://eastus.azuredatabricks.net:443/sql/protocolv1/o/8433778235244215/0210-035431-quad242`

    - Copy your server address.
